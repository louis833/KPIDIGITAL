    score: 0,
    impact: "Without knowing your lead volume, you can't forecast growth, allocate marketing budget effectively, or identify trends. This creates reactive decision-making instead of strategic planning.",
    diyApproach: "Start a simple spreadsheet tracking leads by source each week. Use Google Sheets or Excel with columns for: Date, Source, Lead Count, Notes.",

    impact: "Not knowing your cost per lead means you're gambling with your marketing budget. You might be overspending on poor channels while underinvesting in winners.",

    impact: "No-shows directly impact revenue and waste your team's time. Without tracking, you can't implement prevention strategies or recover lost opportunities.",
