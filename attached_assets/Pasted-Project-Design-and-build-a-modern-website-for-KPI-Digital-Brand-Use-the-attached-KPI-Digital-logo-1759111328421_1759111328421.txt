Project: Design and build a modern website for KPI Digital

Brand: Use the attached KPI Digital logo to extract the color palette and typography style. Keep the design minimal, professional, and bold.

Objective:
Create a high-converting website that positions KPI Digital as the go-to partner for trades businesses (electricians, solar, HVAC) wanting clarity, systems, and growth. The site should clearly communicate the problems trades face, KPI Digital’s solution, and a clear path to engage.
