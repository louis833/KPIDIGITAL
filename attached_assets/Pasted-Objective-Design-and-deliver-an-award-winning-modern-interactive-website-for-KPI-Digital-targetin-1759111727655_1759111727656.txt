Objective
Design and deliver an award-winning, modern, interactive website for KPI Digital, targeting trades businesses (plumbing, electrical, HVAC, carpentry). The site must combine cutting-edge aesthetics, micro-interactions, and storytelling with a rock-solid conversion flow, trust signals, and performance.

Creative Direction

Bold, modern visual language that resonates with blue-collar credibility and digital innovation.

Advanced motion design (scroll triggers, animated reveals, hover/touch interactions) that feel intentional and premium—not gimmicky.

Clear conversion paths: calls, quote requests, and bookings should be visually irresistible.

Social proof, trust badges, and testimonials woven naturally into the flow.

Accessibility and performance must be treated as design features, not afterthoughts.

Experience Design Priorities

Immersive hero with animated headline and interactive CTA.

Pain points → solution storytelling using staggered animations, counters, and parallax.

Value proposition cards with flip/micro-interactions that delight.

3-step process flow animated with progress indicators.

Testimonial carousel with smooth transitions and review schema.

Sticky navigation that adapts with scroll (color, visibility).

Responsive touch-first experience with swipe/gesture support.

Interactive footer with animated icons and secondary CTAs.

Smart, frictionless quote/booking form with conditional fields and file uploads.
